## self introduction

Hi, I‘ Koko. It's a great honor to join this team. I have been working about three years and doing front-end development  near two years. I hope I can get used to the new environment as soon as possible.

In my free time, I like going hiking, playing table tennis. But I'm not very good at them. I just like these kind of exercise, not too hard for me and also can sweet. A good way to relax myself.

Again, It's honor to join this team. Hope we can make progress together.
