How to Build a Todo App with React, TypeScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB

1. [A Practical Guide to TypeScript](https://www.ibrahima-ndaw.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-typescript/)  实用指南
2. **structure** the project as follows 
3. this file structure is **relatively** simple
4. The `dist` directory will **serve as** an output folder once the code has compiled to plain JavaScript.
5. The controllers, types, and routes are also in their **respective** folder names
6. **help the compiler along following our preferences**
7. **informs** TypeScript to compile every `.ts` file located in the `src` folder 告知
8. tells the compiler to do sth.
9. files or folders **passed** in the array. 传递到数组中的文件或文件夹
10. We can now install the dependencies to enable TypeScript in the project. 现在我们可以在项目中安装能够使用 ts 的依赖
11. **Either** locally in the project **or** globally in our machine.  Either...or...
12. I will go for the latter **based on personal preference**, but you can **stick with** the local way if you want too. 基于个人喜好，我会选择后者(**go for the latter**)，但如果你也愿意的话，你也可以坚持当地的方式。
13. help the TypeScript compiler understand the packages
14. `concurrently` will help compile the TypeScript code, keep watching for changes, and also start the server **simultaneously**. 
15. we can now launch the server 现在可以启动服务器了
16. in that regard
17. you can let TypeScript **infer** it for you.
18. type the values explicitly. 显式键入这些值
